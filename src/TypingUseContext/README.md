Thanksgiving weekend 2022.

I'm interested in what was wrong with my attempt to type useReducer in the typingDefender1 branch. So I went back to this old folder, where you are now, and renamed ThirdColorContext to ThirdColorContextWithState.

I get confused about the array (tuple?) that I pass to WhateverContext.Provider's value prop. `<ThirdColorContextWithState.Provider value={[state, setState]}>`
